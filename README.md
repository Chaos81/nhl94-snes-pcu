 **NHL94 SNES Player Card Updater version 0.1**

This tool will update the player cards in a custom roster ROM. In a custom roster ROM, the players are usually not on their original teams, and when the player cards are shown, they are incorrect. This tool will rearrange the Player Card pointers so that the correct Player Card is shown for each player. If there is a player in the ROM that was not originally in the NHL94 ROM, they will be given a generic Player Card.

To use the tool, load the ROM that you would like to correct the Player Cards for. Then, hit the Update Player Cards button, and the tool will ask you where to save the modified ROM to. If there are any errors, the tool will pop up with an error message.

In the executable folder, there is a PC and a Mac folder, each containing a self contained app plus necessary files. You can use these instead of running the Python script, and put the folder whereever you would like on your computer.
